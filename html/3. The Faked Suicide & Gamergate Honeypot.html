<h2 id="gamergate-honeypot">Gamergate Honeypot</h2>
<p>So little Laurelai decided she wanted to get back at the gamergate bois by creating an irc wherein pxdo/hxbephilic conversations were <a href="https://imgur.com/4k5Py2g">vocally permitted</a> (what a low key invite, wow so covert). This was corroborated by <a href="https://imgur.com/lD02kcT">this post</a> and <a href="https://imgur.com/0HJuFlK">this screenshot</a> proving she registered the site. She doesn’t deny it so far as I’ve seen so it’s not like anyone needed an ip trace here but still nice to have.</p>
<p>Anyway, allegedly the reporter she sent all the subsequent information to got picked up for CP because, ya know, she sent them CP. I don’t have a source for this, and I don’t know that it matters too much in the grand scheme of things, but between this and the ip trace, I thought it was a great example of LB’s continual lack of consideration for, you guessed it, operational security.</p>
<p>And look I’m not making a moral judgement one way or another (I mean regardless of her methods these are people that willingly shared CP), but at the very least she set up some heavy shit with not much prompting or support, and it feels like the sort of vigilante activity that, while some of us would potentially salivate over under different circumstances, does have a tendency for a high amount of blowback.</p>
<h2 id="faked-suicide">Faked Suicide</h2>
<p>So anyway there was a high amount of blow back, and as one does, she <a href="https://imgur.com/YZJ6CjI">faked her own suicide</a>. Not because of “cis people” mind you, but because of the “activist community constantly lying about (her).” It was a very simple post, not really saying much, but the content was made somewhat irrelevant when it very quickly became apparent that she had in fact, <a href="https://imgur.com/bgoFmG7">not killed herself</a>. Thankfully, all three posts occurred on the same day, so she didn’t drag it out too much. Oh, and the stalker she mentions is the victim LB (allegedly) <a href="https://pastebin.com/GyzaNTSP">raped</a>. We’ll get to that in chapter 7.</p>
