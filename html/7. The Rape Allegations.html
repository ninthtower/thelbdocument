<p>I don’t actually want to add very much commentary here, and in fact I’d like for the victim’s accounts to speak for themselves. You may also notice that I have yet to include LB’s account of these events. That is intentional, as I wish to present the victim’s testimonies untainted by bad faith memetics.</p>

<p>(we will see the last two victim's accounts in the next chapter.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point in time, and as someone who has personally experienced a great deal of sexual abuse over the course of my lifetime, I feel confident in restating my stance that we should always prefer the testimony of the victim. I understand the nuance some might present, but when multiple victims have already come forth (one of whom did so after she believed LB was already dead and, in my opinion, would have had no stake in furthering any falsehoods), I will adamantly and continuously refuse to side with the accused.</p>
