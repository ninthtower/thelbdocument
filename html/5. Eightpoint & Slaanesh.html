<p>Eightpoint is a Mastodon refuge for former Twitter users that ended up being “very popular with transfemmes” (per the about blurb). There’s a lot of drama surrounding the eightpoint instance but suffice it to say that, someone <em>already</em> excised repeatedly from trans spaces <em>for rape</em> (alleged) amongst other reasons, should not be lying to gain a position of power <em>within another trans space</em>. There is <em>zero</em> reason this is acceptable, and even less so for her to so consistently attempt to be in positions of power knowing full well that, were she to act under her own, authentic name, she would not be welcomed as an administrator. As some have pointed out, even if she had just <em>sat down</em> and stopped trying to set herself up in positions of power, no matter how petty that power may be, then perhaps people wouldn’t <em>still</em> be as angry with her as they are. Makes somewhat inherent sense, right?</p>
<p>So with that said, LB lied about her identity in order to take a position of petty power within the eightpoint mod team. Repeatedly. <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2472f2747904d2eddccf54031044bba6536f0c6c3d126447ec1e2c0625c373b9/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f466b67686c584b2e706e67">screenshots</a> show Slaanesh (untruthfully) spilling details about herself that “could only be true of Laurelai Bailey” (from watchfulness, as spake in <a href="https://gist.github.com/watchfulness/58359155ebf9aec0fa0d4855982dfce0">this post</a>). Finally, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230212131014/https://eightpoint.app/@autogynamelia/109479334782438273">confronted directly</a>, LB states “I didn’t lie to you to fool you, i lied to you to protect you.”</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen the confession, here’s Slaanesh’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVGV6dVtq_cbj2YC78Beqp8sLeTylIkjaFeTiM92D7I/edit?tab=t.0">post</a> (made before the previous ones, of course) claiming that “it’s not true, I’m not Laurelai Bailey,” and posting screenshots of Ariadne, an administrator of treehouse.system, preparing to out her (also she uses starlink, ew). I’m sure in the moment it was very convincing but now that everyone is aware of the connection, it’s a bit of a scuzzy read.</p>
<p>As mentioned, there’s other drama involved here but ultimately my point in including this segment is to demonstrate that <em>even as late as 2022</em>, Laurelai Bailey was willfully lying about her identity in order to set herself as an authority over marginalized and vulnerable people against their will. <em>Again</em>. For someone who preaches restorative justice, I would really like to see more of an effort towards the restoration.</p>
<p>But hey, maybe in the next chapter we’ll see a bit of a redemption arc! Let’s go take a look.</p>
