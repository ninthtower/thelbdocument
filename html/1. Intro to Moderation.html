            <p>
                Name: Laurelai Bailey<br />
                Aliases: A lot. stuxnetsource, slaanesh, bimbopolitics, hypnotransgirl, ephraelstern, contentleftist, grittynroses, sapphicmindbreak, and more that I was less able to confirm.<br />
                Age: 29 in 2011, 43 in 2025
            </p>
            <p>
                None of the above is meant to “dox” her; in fact all this info is publically available. However, I think it’s important to illustrate both the breadth of her reach, her propensity for adopting new identities, and her age.
                This isn’t some kid, she’s a 40+ year old woman who was almost 30 at the time our story begins.

            <p>
                The intended goal of this piece is to bring awareness to a pattern of behavior not only exhibited by one Laurelai Bailey, henceforth referred to as LB, but to bring awareness to the behavioral patterns of those like her.
                This is a clear and visible trail of abuse, lies, and intentional malice, not befitting someone who is so frequently allowed to hold positions of power over vulnerable people without question, and in many cases, with the
                explicit protection and knowing allowance of those around her.

            <p>
                One of the first things people will point out about LB is that she was a mod <em>everywhere</em>, she has so many credits to her name: r/shitredditsays (allegedly, although she herself states
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/a:t5_2tp8b/comments/qpkz8/comment/c3zgk6m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">she was not</a>), r/lgbt,
                r/asktransgender, r/transgender, r/ainbow, r/gaymers, r/occupywallstreet, r/anonymous, r/rape (problematic for <em>so many reasons</em> that we’ll get into soon), r/contrapoints, r/antiwork (which gets its own story later);
                in spite of a vast wealth of controversy, LB still moderated some of these places as of 2022, though with her tendency to create new socks I truly couldn’t say which of these she’s still affiliated with, even if she does
                claim to have given up reddit altogether. A majority of the time it appears that she
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/a:t5_2tp8b/comments/qpkz8/comment/c3zfgbw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">volunteers</a> for the positions, rather
                than being approached, and very little vetting takes place, though much of this is due to the way she presents her expertise (more on that later). While she has apologized for a small portion of her behavior as a mod under
                varying circumstances, records clearly show that this is someone with a <em>constant</em> &amp; <em>unending</em> stream of
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/a:t5_2tp8b/comments/qpkz8/former_rlgbt_mod_laurelai_qa/">interpersonal complaints</a> against her, who acts to this day as though she’s done nothing truly wrong (as we’ll see in Laurelai
                Demystified).
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s not to mention how she continually defers the blame to other folks around her, as seen in her blame of the
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/qk66n/comment/c3z0ioe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">r/lgbt mods</a> using, as one user pointed
                out, a very classic
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/qk66n/comment/c3z64di/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">nuremberg defense</a> (and this conflicts
                with <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GmCah#ddnMq">these screenshots</a> here that show the mod team taking issue with LB’s actions {begins after all the red deleted comments, complete with a particularly juicy section whereupon
                she <em>questions her opposition’s nationality and grasp of english</em> (<a href="">1 fix</a>)(<a href="">2 fix</a>). She also, when questioned
                about why the mod team didn’t step down when faced with backlash from r/lgbt, stated that “statistics from the moderator control panel” led them to believe that it was “
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/a:t5_2tp8b/comments/qpkz8/comment/c3zhmsm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">not the true voice of the community</a>”
                (a touch gatekeepy, when you look at her metrics for establishing this).
            </p>
            <p>
                Really, rather than posting every single instance, I’d encourage you to look at the previously linked thread (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/a:t5_2tp8b/comments/qpkz8/former_rlgbt_mod_laurelai_qa/">linked again here</a>)
                which I think contains sufficient examples of her behavior and response to it. I think the issues with her moderation style become even more apparent in <a href="">chapter 4 fix</a>.
