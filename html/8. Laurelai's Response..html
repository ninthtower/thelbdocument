<p>Now that we’ve seen the allegations against her, and the breadth of concerns raised about LB’s behavior, I invite you to read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T0SI9qWKnJuLnErfUuyMg6uDB39RbHFX/view?usp=sharing">Laurelai Demystified</a>.</p>
<p>I have no further commentary on the matter, other than to say I find it interesting that, according to this document, proof of these claims will only be provided upon request. I have yet to encounter that issue across the entirety of my research thus far with any other source included here.</p>
<p>So I requested the proof, and I read through the whole document. As a preliminary point of consideration, a lot of these screenshots and conversations were difficult for me to access, especially the ones that are more obviously incriminating. I find it noteworthy that <em>so many</em> of these are so readily available in this document, which was only seemingly created in February of this year. For various reasons, I’m unsure who exactly authored it, though it is currently contained on Laurelai’s Google Drive. I’m going to include it, in its entirety, for consideration. I won’t spend too much time editorializing, but there are a few things I’d like to highlight.</p>
<p>The entire document is written in such a way that it truly seems more set on discrediting LB’s opponents than offering a genuine investigation, set of evidence, or response. This is made even more abundantly clear when the author of the document <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fmys2Cl-RGqywhxhoXJ2e-X-ZoE_eLmD/view?usp=sharing">left in an outline</a> describing their “game plan” to “discredit” Zoey, one of the victims, and several other people involved. The document also mentions, repeatedly, that some of the women involved were allegedly rapists themselves. That is something I think each of you can decide after looking at the material, and it is outside of the scope of this document to speculate on. However, I’d like to remind you that someone who is abused can also themselves be an abuser, and someone who is an abuser can also be abused.</p>
<p>What’s worse, is that these are people who are frustrated, angry, and hurt. I’m not giving their actions a pass, but I do strongly feel that any attempt to wield their actions against them is disingenuous. There’s even a section where the author states of <a href="https://crystallineprincess.tumblr.com/post/88468703915/shitty-experiences-with-other-transwomen-who-could">this</a> testimony (which I recommend you stop and go read first), that “Laurelai was an asshole about this disagreement, which sent this person into a BPD episode where they began to self-harm. While I empathize with this situation and agree that Laurelai was likely in the wrong here, the testimony is clearly from an emotional place.” I don’t think I need to go into the issue with discrediting this account, which supports LB’s constant abuse of those around her, by claiming it’s too emotional.</p>
<p>In addition, there are <em>countless</em> examples of those who have been sexually abused realizing their abuse after the fact, and recounting their story with a different tone. There are just as many cases of those who initially spoke out, only to be bullied or, in some instances, gaslit and abused into recanting their story. Again, it is disingenuous to paint the victims as liars because they did not recognize the extent of their trauma right away, or because they later felt afraid and chose community, however toxic, over isolation.</p>
<p>Lastly, and in my opinion most importantly, this is someone who was allowed to moderate a subreddit meant as a safe space for abuse victims, r/rape. Laurelai Bailey, if she were approaching this discussion in good faith, would understand why her words (and actions) on the topic are hurtful and callous. If she were approaching it in good faith, she would offer a heartfelt apology, at the very least for accidentally causing so much mental and emotional anguish. But all we have seen for the last 14 years is Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender.</p>
