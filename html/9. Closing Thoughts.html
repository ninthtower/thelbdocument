<p>I’m not asking anyone to believe me, or to believe any single account here on its own. Rather, I’m asking you to take a look at the broader pattern, the consistent trail of destruction left in her wake, and ask yourself if this is the sort of person you can trust. With so many verifiable lies, and such blatant avoidance of personal responsibility, how can you truly take her at her word?</p>
<p>Laurelia Bailey to this day is still active within the trans community. In fact, she is currently the high priestess of a Discord server called The Temple Of Inanna, having seemingly been one of the founding members. This place has been a refuge for many vulnerable trans folx and, at least in writing, is meant to be a space that values authenticity, love, and justice. The temple itself deserves to stand as a bastion for those who belong there, for those who feel drawn to one of the few ancient practices that actually accepts us with open arms.</p>
<p>But Laurelai Bailey has no place there. You can see it in the way she talks to the adherents of the temple, the way she performs the same centralization and “defanging” seen in the r/antiwork saga. You can see it in the way she speaks, claiming to be the one who knows all and can save you all from yourself, accusing members of not thinking rationally, claiming they’re being emotionally exploited and that only she can “keep everyone safe.” Her position in the temple allows her to claim divine authority and wield it in whatever direction she pleases, and while there have seemingly (so far as I’ve seen or been made aware) not been any high stakes incidents just yet, it is immensely difficult to trust someone with such a vast history of blatant abuse.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most critically, I <em>understand</em> the temple’s stance on restorative justice, and I truly believe in it. but this is not a person who has exhibited a desire for change. This is a person who has performed the same actions over and over again without seemingly any intent to stop and take stock of the problem. This is someone who has not extended that same restorative justice to others, and who has caused heavy amounts of harm to innocent and vulnerable people time and again. I don’t like to make the case that a person doesn’t deserve community, and I’m certainly not making it here, but I urge every single one of you to consider whether this is a person that deserves to be in <em>yours</em>.’</p>
