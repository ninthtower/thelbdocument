<p>I’m not asking anyone to believe me, or to believe any single account here on its own. Rather, I’m asking you to take a look at the broader pattern, the consistent trail of destruction left in her wake, and ask yourself if this is the sort of person you can trust. With so many verifiable lies, and such blatant avoidance of personal responsibility, how can you truly take her at her word?</p>
<p>Laurelai Bailey to this day is still active within the trans community. In fact, she is currently the high priestess of a Discord server called The Temple Of Inanna, having seemingly been one of the founding members. This place has been a refuge for many vulnerable trans folx and, at least in writing, is meant to be a space that values authenticity, love, and justice. The temple itself deserves to stand as a bastion for those who belong there, for those who feel drawn to one of the few ancient practices that actually accepts us with open arms.</p>
<p>But Laurelai Bailey has no place there. You can see it in the way she talks to the adherents of the temple, the way she performs the same centralization and “defanging” seen in the r/antiwork saga. You can see it in the way she speaks, claiming to be the one who knows all and can save you all from yourself, accusing members of not thinking rationally, claiming they’re being emotionally exploited and that only she can “keep everyone safe.” Her position in the temple allows her to claim divine authority and wield it in whatever direction she pleases, and while there have seemingly (so far as I’ve seen or been made aware) not been any high stakes incidents just yet, it is immensely difficult to trust someone with such a vast history of blatant abuse.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most critically, I <em>understand</em> the temple’s stance on restorative justice, and I truly believe in it. but this is not a person who has exhibited a desire for change. This is a person who has performed the same actions over and over again without seemingly any intent to stop and take stock of the problem. This is someone who has not extended that same restorative justice to others, and who has caused heavy amounts of harm to innocent and vulnerable people time and again. I don’t like to make the case that a person doesn’t deserve community, and I’m certainly not making it here, but I urge every single one of you to consider whether this is a person that deserves to be in <em>yours</em>.’</p>
<p>I’d like to leave one last comment made by the Entu (high priestess) of Innana’s Temple: “While Laurelai is our other Entu and is thus equal in rank to me, and she does have an active presence within the community, she’s not the brains behind the whole operation, nor is she the one who developed our materials, policies, so on and so forth. I wrote and developed 90% of what makes the temple what it is, especially when it comes to educational materials, theology, structure, etc. I know how scary it can be when youre looking for a new community and you find someone at the top had a lot of sketchy stuff said about them, it makes you wonder how much of that place is even related to them or their works, that’s why I’m mentioning this. When I was asked to come along and contribute during the founding of this temple I had to make sure that in the end, I’d be making a place where people are safe, respected, and the community fostered there would be within Inanna’s ethos, and would be a good reflection of her teachings. I’m confident that I’ve done that. You’re free to form your own opinions about Laurelai, and hopefully (the Debunking Document) is able to provide you with enough of the data on Laurelai that your questions and concerns are satisfied, but I’m also hoping you’ll see that there’s much more to our temple than just a place Laurelai spends a few hours a week.”</p>
